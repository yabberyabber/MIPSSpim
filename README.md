# MIPSSpim
Lab 3 for CSC 315

I'm pretty sure throughout the quarter Retz will have us add more and more functionality to this assembler so let's continue using this repo.  Also I'm pretty sure he's going to have us write a mips assembly interpretor and I think that should go here.  

I put all the specs we have so far (that pdf) in the specs directory.  

I half baked an idea for how this project might be organized (I think it's pretty similar to how lzw was organized).  The header files have a comment at the top saying what I imagine that pair of files should do, but nothing's set in stone.  Let me know if you have any concerns.  Tonight (after I do my other homework) I'll add function headers to the .h files.

Don't be afraid to call me out on my bull shit... I'm not as opinionated as I may appear...
